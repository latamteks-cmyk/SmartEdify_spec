# Incident Response Runbook

## Incident Classification

### Critical (P0)
- Complete service outage affecting multiple tenants
- Security breach or data compromise
- Loss of legal evidence integrity
- Compliance violation

### High (P1)
- Service degradation affecting core functionality
- Single tenant complete outage
- Performance below SLO thresholds

### Medium (P2)
- Minor functionality issues
- Individual user access problems
- Non-critical security events

### Low (P3)
- Minor service issues with workaround
- Non-urgent feature requests
- Documentation updates

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Notification
1. Monitoring system detects issue
2. Alert routed to on-call engineer
3. Engineer acknowledges within 5 minutes
4. If unable to respond, escalate to next tier
5. Determine severity level within 15 minutes

### 2. Initial Response
1. Verify issue exists and scope of impact
2. Create incident ticket with:
   - Start time
   - Affected services
   - Initial impact assessment
   - Communication channel
3. If P0 or P1, notify stakeholders within 15 minutes
4. Begin initial mitigation efforts

### 3. Investigation
1. Collect relevant logs
2. Identify root cause
3. Determine resolution approach
4. Estimate time to resolution
5. Update incident ticket with findings

### 4. Resolution
1. Implement fix or workaround
2. Verify resolution in test environment if applicable
3. Deploy fix to production
4. Monitor for recurrence
5. Close incident when resolved

### 5. Follow-up
1. Conduct post-incident review
2. Update runbooks with new information
3. Identify prevention measures
4. Update documentation

## Common Incidents and Solutions

### Identity Service Outage
**Symptoms**: Users unable to authenticate
**Possible Causes**: 
- JWKS cache failure
- Database connectivity issues
- WebAuthn provider problems

**Steps**:
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify JWKS cache status
3. Check Redis connectivity
4. Validate WebAuthn provider status
5. If emergency, enable fallback authentication

### Compliance Service Failure
**Symptoms**: Governance operations failing
**Possible Causes**:
- Policy evaluation timeouts
- Cache invalidation issues
- Emergency mode activation

**Steps**:
1. Check policy cache hit rate
2. Verify policy CDN connectivity
3. If in emergency mode, begin compliance validation
4. Monitor for post-validation corrections

### Database Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Slow API responses, timeouts
**Possible Causes**:
- Query performance
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Missing indexes

**Steps**:
1. Check database connection pool
2. Review slow query logs
3. Verify RLS policy performance
4. Add indexes if needed
5. Optimize queries
