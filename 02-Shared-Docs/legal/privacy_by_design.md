# Privacy by Design Framework for SmartEdify

## Principles

### 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventive not Remedial
SmartEdify anticipates and prevents privacy invasions before they occur, rather than waiting for privacy risks to materialize.

### 2. Privacy as the Default Setting
Personal data is automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact.

### 3. Privacy Embedded into Design
Privacy is not bolted on as an add-on feature; it is integrated into the system from the ground up.

### 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
Accommodating legitimate interests of all stakeholders while maintaining privacy. No unnecessary trade-offs.

### 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection
All data has a comprehensive lifecycle, from collection through destruction, with appropriate privacy and security measures at each stage.

### 6. Visibility and Transparency
Ensuring operations remain under the control of the organization and are visible to users subject to privacy rights.

### 7. Respect for User Privacy
Keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options.

## Implementation in SmartEdify Architecture

### Identity Service
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential authentication attributes stored
- **Purpose Limitation**: Credentials used only for authentication purposes
- **User Control**: Users can manage authentication methods
- **Data Encryption**: All credential data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Retention Management**: Automatic deletion of unused credentials after defined period

### User Profiles Service
- **Granular Consent**: Users control which personal attributes are shared
- **Consent Audit**: All consent changes logged with immutable timestamps
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can update their profile information
- **Privacy Preferences**: Users set privacy levels for different data types
- **Data Portability**: Mechanisms to export personal data in standard formats

### Tenancy Service
- **Legal Basis**: Data processing justified by contractual necessity
- **Access Controls**: RLS ensures data isolation between tenants
- **Data Minimization**: Only required organizational data stored
- **Purpose Limitation**: Tenant data used only for service provision

### Compliance Service
- **Jurisdiction Mapping**: Automatic application of relevant privacy laws
- **DSAR Orchestration**: Automated processing of data subject requests
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logs of all compliance actions
- **Policy Enforcement**: Real-time validation of data processing activities

## Technical Controls

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: HSM-based key storage with 90-day rotation
- **PII Protection**: Encryption of all personally identifiable information

### Access Control
- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust based on network location
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **PBAC**: Policy-based access control using OPA with signed bundles
- **Session Management**: Time-limited sessions with device fingerprinting

### Data Lifecycle Management
- **Data Classification**: Automatic classification of data sensitivity
- **Retention Policies**: Automated enforcement of data retention rules
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic deletion with verification
- **Data Minimization**: Automatic removal of unnecessary data
